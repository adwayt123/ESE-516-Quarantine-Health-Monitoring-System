# ESE-516-Quarantine-Health-Monitoring-System
The goal of this project is to use the concepts of IoT to remotely monitor the vitals of a patient afflicted with mild/moderate symptoms of COVID-19 and to restrict further spread of infection by controlling the ambient temperature and humidity of the room. Further, an SOS signal was added to aid the patient and call his/her guardian/caretaker.
